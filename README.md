# HTML templates for repetitive elements in ASP.NET & DotVVM

In this repository we can find one of the DotVVM controls to render HTML templates for items in a given collection, this control is called Repeater.

Repeater is a tag that allows us to set a preset HTML template to render items from a given listing. In other words, this control repeats a template for each item in a referenced collection in a DataSource.
